NetBeez
--------------------------------------------------------
Coding exercise for NetBeez Front End Engineer position.
by Daniel Tompkins

Instructions to run: go to https://l00sed.github.com/NetBeez.git/

		-- or --

Open the index.html file in the browswer ( Chrome or Firefox for best results )

		-- or --
run:
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1

in the project directory, then open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000

To use the "app" to receive the desired output; the user should make sure to format
their input string similar to the input form's placeholder value. Simply click "SUBMIT",
and you'll hopefully see the box jump to a new position displaying the coordinates.
If you'd like the raw data output, there is an active console.log on the output variables
generating these coordinate labels. If you right-click, inspect and open the developer
console sidebar, you should be able to see those variables output after a successful
form submission. This was my first time using p5.js! I really enjoyed the task.
Please let me know if you have any questions or problems with the package.

Warm Regards,

Daniel Tompkins
